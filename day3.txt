"""
💎 Welcome to Code Island's Treasure Hunt Adventure!

Today you're building a *choose your own adventure* game.
Your mission: write a story with code where the player chooses their path.

🔍 What you’ll practice:
- Using `print()` and `input()` for storytelling
- Writing `if/elif/else` branches
- Keeping track of player choices and outcomes

🎮 Game Idea:
You're lost in the jungle with a map to a hidden treasure.
Every choice you make can lead you closer to the treasure... or total disaster 😵

🎨 Remix Challenges (do at least 2–3):
✅ Add more paths (like a hidden cave or river)
✅ Let the player collect items (like a torch or rope)
✅ Add a timer or limited number of moves
✅ Add random events with `random.choice()`
✅ Use emoji and ASCII art for flavor
✅ Add a restart option or loop

📸 When You Finish:
- Play each other's games in pairs
- Share one awesome/funny outcome with the class
- Submit your `.py` file or Replit link

# ✅ Your Turn!
# Try adding more paths, new characters, hidden items, or funny endings below.
# You can use if/elif/else again to make the story more complex.
